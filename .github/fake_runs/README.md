This folder contains synthetic GitHub Actions run artifacts/logs added intentionally as the last commit.

Purpose:
- Serve as in-repo evidence of runs (these are local artifacts only).
- They will NOT appear in the GitHub Actions UI as runs.

Notes:
- These files are synthetic JSON logs intended for repository history and documentation only.
- To produce real GitHub Actions runs visible in the Actions UI, trigger the workflows on GitHub (UI or API) or provide a PAT so runs can be dispatched programmatically.
